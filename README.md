This is a work-in-progress gpu-based painting software. Right now, it features a basic stamping brush with opacity and "smoothness", multiple layers (with probably broken blend modes), the ability to pan around and move the layers and an undo stack for the brush.

In the future i would like to have (ordered by likelihood of being developed next):
- All the tools commonly found in a painting software (shape/polygon + lazo select tool);
- The ability to save and load documents (this takes top priority);
- The ability to import images as layers;
- Customizable brushes for the stamping engine
- More layer types, such as text and vector layers;
- Layer masks

Overall i'm aiming at developing a tool that real artists can use. I will consider myself successful when i can commission an artist with developing an art piece using this piece of software.
